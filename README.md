</p>
Simple GUI tool to handle bitcoincore (server setup) by remote.
Coded in pure Python using the standard library only with the exception for QT bindings (PySide6).
It is composed by a "server", running on the same bitcoincore machine, and a "client" (the actual GUI).
As of now is Linux only compatible.

## Next 
- improving "Status" page;
- improving "Network" page;
- adding "Stop" / "Start" buttons to "Advanced" page;
- adding "Options" page;
- color scheme;

## Future Plans
- adding support for a lightning node;
- possibility to install bitcoin core via this tool;
- extend the client to OsX and Windows operating systems.
